# 💼 front-end-interview-questions

Welcome to my interview questions repository! Here you will find a collection of genuine interview questions asked by real companies that I have encountered recently.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of the interview questions I have encountered, and to share them with others who may find them helpful. I will continue to add more questions as long as I keep interviewing.

## 🔎 Usage

Feel free to browse the questions in this repository to prepare for your own interviews. You can also use this repository as a resource to improve your skills in specific areas. If you find this repository helpful, please give it a star!

## 📖 Content

This project has two sections: one for algorithm problems and the other for front-end related problems. In the future, others may add more interview questions.

Algorithms:

- [Find if target sum in a binary search tree]()
- [Print all the combinations, each items in one combination should be a sub palindrome string]()

Front-end:

- [parallel scheduler with promises]()
